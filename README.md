# Theriac
## Inspiration
Mental health and wellness involve the state of a person's mind, which affects their thoughts, emotions, and actions. However, people often do not prioritize their mental health and do not know how to address it. Additionally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, people are hesitant to visit hospitals for appointments. While there are various delivery apps like UberEats, SkipTheDishes, and DoorDash, none of them deliver medications. This makes it difficult for patients to keep track of their medications as pharmacies do not have a single platform. To solve this issue, our website **Theriac** can be used to connect patients with pharmacies. Additionally, insurance premiums are rising, and even though some people lead healthy, low-risk lifestyles, they may not receive lower life insurance premiums. Insurance providers may assess safety information during the start of a policy, but it can be updated regu
## What it does
Theriac brings the hospital to your home and offers the following services:

    - An innovative, time-conscious mental health chatbot.
    - A chatbot that asks about your symptoms and schedules a suitable doctor's appointment.
    - 24/7 delivery of medications prescribed by the doctor.
    - Post-appointment instructions and recommendations for recovery.
    - Tracking of the user's health and rewards in the form of reduced insurance premiums.

The Theriac chatbot uses conversational AI technology to raise awareness about mental health and serve as a mental wellness companion for people of all ages, races, and genders. Unlike humans, the Theriac chatbot is available 24/7, and users can freely share and communicate without fear of judgment. Chatbots provide a great experience while maintaining the user's privacy and anonymity. Texting has become a common means of communication, and chatbots offer a positive experience while preserving the user's privacy and anonymity. The mental health module of the chatbot provides self-assessment, healthy practices, and exercises to help people maintain their mental health. It also has a motivation module with tips, motivation, and encouraging quotes, as well as various additional activities. Theriac is mindful of the user's time and provides suggestions to ensure that the user never feels lost while conversing with the chatbot.

Theriac is a website that allows customers to obtain prescription medications from the comfort of their own homes. The user simply needs to upload their prescription, select a pharmacy, and choose pickup or delivery. They can also quickly and easily order and request refills. The website stores all of the user's medication information, including past orders, current prescriptions, total medication costs, and active medications. Customers can safely access their profile on our website and enter their delivery address, doctor information, healthcare information, insurance information, and preferred pharmacy information. Notification settings allow the user to be notified when their order has been approved by the pharmacy and when it will be delivered, as well as when they are due for a refill.

Theriac tracks the user's health. Users can link to Google Fit through the "Life insurance" option, which synchronizes real-time information about their heart rate, daily step count, diet, and other parameters into our app. The Google App Store has over 50 major apps that connect to Google Fit. These apps sync with wearables and other smart health devices, track health data such as weight and caloric intake, and automatically import workouts. We use all of this information to create an aggregate score, which we compare to the scores of other users on the platform. Significant life insurance discounts may be available based on your score and ranking
